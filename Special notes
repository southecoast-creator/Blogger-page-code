<h3>Cons of Blogger (And Honest Workarounds)</h3>

<p><strong>1. Limited Built-in Features</strong><br>
Blogger doesn’t come with advanced tools like page builders, membership plugins, or complex analytics out of the box.</p>

<div style="background:#f5efff; border:1px solid #d8cfff; border-radius:12px; padding:16px; margin:12px 0;">
<strong>Workaround:</strong><br>
Use free external tools instead. Canva for design, Google Forms for email collection, Gumroad or Paystack for payments, and Google Analytics for tracking. Blogger integrates smoothly with all of them.

<p><strong>2. Fewer Themes Compared to Paid Platforms</strong><br>
Blogger’s theme library is small and can feel outdated at first glance.</p>

<div style="background:#f5efff; border:1px solid #d8cfff; border-radius:12px; padding:16px; margin:12px 0;">
<strong>Workaround:</strong><br>
Customize themes manually or use free premium-style Blogger templates from trusted designers. With simple layout edits, fonts, and colors, Blogger themes can look just as polished.

<p><strong>3. No Built-In Membership or Course System</strong><br>
Unlike some paid platforms, Blogger doesn’t offer native membership or course hosting.</p>

<div style="background:#f5efff; border:1px solid #d8cfff; border-radius:12px; padding:16px; margin:12px 0;">
<strong>Workaround:</strong><br>
Host content externally using Google Drive, Notion, or Gumroad, then link access pages directly from your blog. Blogger works well as the front-facing hub.

<p><strong>4. Limited Support & Updates</strong><br>
Blogger doesn’t receive frequent flashy updates, and official support is minimal.</p>

<div style="background:#f5efff; border:1px solid #d8cfff; border-radius:12px; padding:16px; margin:12px 0;">
<strong>Workaround:</strong><br>
Blogger’s simplicity is its strength. Fewer updates mean fewer things breaking. Community tutorials, forums, and experimentation fill the gap effectively.
